# ArrayChanger by egoriwe999
My program with the ability to perform 4 functions by changing the array. This program defines an array, removes an element at array index, inserts a new element at array index, finds the maximum sum between i and j, and outputs the interval of these numbers to a new array, deleting them from the old one. Also, work with memory was carried out here, any memory leaks were eliminated and tested on valgrind.

#1 to Set values of array.

#2 to Inserting a new element into the array by index.

#3 to Removing an array element by index.

#4 to Do personal task.

#5 to Finish program
